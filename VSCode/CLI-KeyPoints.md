cp [old] [new] copies a file.

mkdir[path] creates a new directory.

mv [old] [new] moves(renames) a file or directory.

rm [path] removes (deletes) a file.

* matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt.

? matches any single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt but not any.txt.

Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including Ctrl-X, Control-X, and ^X.

The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.

Most files' names are something.extension. The extension isn't required, and don't quarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.

Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.
