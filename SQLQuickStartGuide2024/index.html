    <h1>SQL - Structured Query Language</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>Key SQL Statements</p>
      <li>
        <span>SELECT</span> - used to retrieve data from a database (Can be as
        simple as selecting specific column from a table or as complex as
        combining data from multiple tables based on logical relationships)
        <ul>
          <p>
            SELECT basic syntax: begins with 'SELECT', followed by the columns
            to retrieve, the 'FROM' clause indicating the table to query, and an
            ~*optional*~ 'WHERE' to clause to filter records
          </p>
          <li>
            SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name<br />
            WHERE condition;
          </li>
          <br />
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>INSERT INTO</span> - to add new records to a table (specifies the
        table to insert the data into and the values to add)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>UPDATE</span> - to modify existing records (identifies the table
        and the specific records to update, based on a condition, and specifies
        the new values)
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>DELETE</span> - to remove records from a table (removes records
        that match a specified condition)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Clauses and Conditions:</p>
      <li>
        <span>WHERE</span> - specifies a condition for filtering records and can
        use logical operators to combine conditions
      </li>
      <ul>
        <p>Logical Operators</p>
        <li>AND</li>
        <li>OR</li>
        <li>NOT</li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li>
        <span>ORDER BY</span> - determines the order in which the results are
        returned, based on one or more columns
      </li>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>ASC - ascending</li>
        <li>DESC - descending</li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li>
        <span>GROUP BY</span> - aggregates rows that have the same values in
        specified columns into summary rows
      </li>
      <ul>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <li>sum</li>
        <li>average</li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li>
        <span>HAVING</span> - similar to WHERE clause but used exclusively to
        filter rows after they have been grouped.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>SQL Data Types</p>
      <li>numeric</li>
      <li>data and time</li>
      <li>string (character and/or textual)</li>
      <li>+more</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Best Practices</p>
      <li>always use explicit column names in your SELECT statements</li>
      <li>use the WHERE clause to filter rows efficiently</li>
      <li>
        make use of comments to enhance readability and maintainability of your
        SQL scripts
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>The Difference Between SQL and NoSQL</p>
      <li><span>SQL</span></li>
      <li>
        SQL databases - a.k.a relational databases - are structured in a way
        that allows for the storage and retrieval of data in relation to other
        data in said database
      </li>
      <ul>
        <p>Examples of popular SQL databases</p>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>Oracle</li>
        <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          These systems are widely used in scenarios where data integrity and
          relationships are crucial (ie: financial records, customer
          relationship management (CRM) systems, and other applications where
          transactions are complex and interconnected)
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li>
        These databases are table-bases, meaning data is organized into rows and
        columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a
        data attribute
      </li>
      <li>
        SQL - the language used to communicate with these databases is highly
        structured allowing for complex queries and transactions
      </li>
      <li>
        This structure ensures data integrity and relationships through
        predefined schemas and rules (ie: foreign keys) which enforce the
        relational aspect of the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        SQL databases are traditionally scaled by enhancing the horse-power of
        the hardware, known as vertical scaling, which can be expensive and has
        physical limitations.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><span>NoSQL</span></li>
      <li>
        NoSQL databases are designed to handle a wide variety of data types
      </li>
      <ul>
        <p>NoSQL data types:</p>
        <li>structured</li>
        <li>semi-structured</li>
        <li>unstructured</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed table structure and are more
        flexable which allows for easy storage and retrieval. This makes NoSQL
        databases ideal for handling big data and real-time web applications.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <p>Types of NoSQL databases</p>
        <br />
        each is optimized for specific kinds of data and use cases, from storing
        large volumes of simple key-value pairs to efficiently managing highly
        connected data for social networks or recommendation systems
        <br />
        <p>Document Databases</p>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        <li>Couchbase</li>
        <p>Key-value stores</p>
        <li>Redis</li>
        <li>DynamoDB</li>
        <p>Wide-column stores</p>
        <li>Cassandra</li>
        <li>HBase</li>
        <p>Graph database</p>
        <li>Neo4j</li>
        <li>Amazon Neptune</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li>
        NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling, which involves
        adding more servers or nodes to the database system to handle larger
        volumes of traffic and data. This scalability makes NoSQL databases
        particularly suited to rapid growth and the varying demands ofmodern web
        applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="conclusion">
      In choosing between SQL and NoSQL, considerations include
      <span
        >the specific requirements of the application, the complexity of the
        data relationships, scalability needs, and the expertise of the
        development team</span
      >. <br /><br />SQL databases are often preferred when
      <span
        >transactional integrity (ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency,
        Isolation, Durability) is paramount and the data structure is clear and
        unlikely to change frequently</span
      >.<br /><br />NoSQL databases, conversely,
      <span
        >offer more flexibility and scalability, which can be beneficial in
        rapidly evolving environments where the data schema can change over
        time</span
      >.<br /><br />
      Understanding the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases is essential
      for anyone looking to efficiently store, manage, and analyze data. By
      aligning database selection with the specific requirements and challenges
      of each project, professionals can ensure robust, scalable, and effective
      data management solutions.

    <ul>
      <p>Types of SQL Commands</p>
      <li><span>Data Query Language (DQL)</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>SELECT</p>
          <br />
          perhaps the most frquently used SQL command. Allows you to query the
          db for specific info. you can use it to retrieve data from one or more
          tables, filter records with specific conditions, +more. It's the
          starting point for any data analysis task, enabling users to fetch and
          aggregate data as required
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li><span>Data Definition Language (DDL)</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>CREATE</p>
          <br />
          creates new dbs, tables, or other db objects. Lays the foundation upon
          which data will be stores and managed
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>ALTER</p>
          <br />
          lets you modify the structure of an existing db object (ie. adding or
          deleting columns in a table or changing a column's data type)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>DROP</p>
          <br />
          used to delete entire dbs, tables, or views. A powerful command that
          should be used with caution as it removes objects and their data
          permanently.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>TRUNCATE</p>
          <br />
          used to delete all records from a table while leaving the table
          structure itself.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <li><span>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>INSERT</p>
          <br />
          used to add new records to a table. It allows specifying which values
          will go into each column of the table for a new row.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>UPDATE</p>
          <br />
          used to modify existing records ina table. Can change the values in
          one or more columns for all rows that meet certain criteria
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>DELETE</p>
          <br />
          similar to TRUNCATE, DELETE removes rows from a table. However, it
          offers more control, as you can specify exactly which rows to remove
          based on certain conditions.
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li><span>Data Control Language (DCL)</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>GRANT</p>
          <br />
          allows specific users to perform specific tasks, like accessing,
          modifying, and executing particular transactions on the db
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>REVOKE</p>
          <br />
          takes back the permissions granted to the users, thus preventing them
          from performing certain operations on the db objects
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <li><span>Transaction Control Language (TCL)</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>COMMIT</p>
          <br />
          used to save all transactions made by DML statements like INSERT,
          UPDATE, or DELETE since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>ROLLBACK</p>
          <br />
          used to undo transactions that have not yet been committed, helping in
          error handling and ensuring data integrity
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>SAVEPOINT</p>
          <br />
          allows setting a point within a transaction to which you can later
          rollback, providing a way to partially undo changes within a larger
          transaction
        </li>
        <br />
      </ul>
    </ul>
